# SimpleAngularJSBootstrapUIServersidePagination
Simplest case example of an AngularJS app using Bootstrap UI Pagination directive, with a 
paged set of local data retrieved from a REST resource.

Created as a learning exercise to combine Bootstrap UI Pagination with $http to retrieve data
from the server.
